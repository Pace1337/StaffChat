# You may use unicode characters if you'd like. If you are. Please add -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 to your start up script to ensure it saves properly.
# Using placeholders is not recommended because it is still in beta and being worked on. Make sure to download placeholder expansion if you use it though.
# Like you can use /papi ecloud download Player then you can use the placeholder %player_name%, but as I said, enabling placeholders is not recommended.
# If you do not know how to use webhooks please read the plugin post there is a quick explanation. Webhook logs all the chat messages. Adminchat, devchat and sc.
# DiscordWebhook is in beta and there are some issues, plugin developer is working on fixing them one by one.
